let a,b,c;
a=b=c=6*5  //all variable get assigned the same value
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);
//tricky Operations in Js
console.log("1"+2+4);   // o/p -> 124
console.log(1+2+"4");   // o/p -> 34 (consider the left most element data type)

// === does strict check that is compare value as well as data type of two variables/consonants
